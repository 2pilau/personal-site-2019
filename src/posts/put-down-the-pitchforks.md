A while back I witnessed a conversation between two developers. I feel like I've seen similar conversations play out infinitely on twitter since then. 

One developer had spent the previous few months focusing on increasing the accessibility of an existing large scale project. The other was a respected voice on accessibility.

The first developer had been talking passionately to me about the accessibility gains they'd made and seemed excited to get the second developers feedback on the project. \
\
But this never happened. \
\
Instead, as soon as the framework was mentioned, this conversation dissolved into a gunslinging cesspit of needless, ego-driven negativity. Both developers were on the same side. Both developers were advocating for the user. But neither of them were actually listening for long enough to hear the other person.

The comments, from both sides, were a reactionary mess, tainted by existing preconceptions. They were only listening to the bits of the conversation that confirmed their own biases, and they were ignoring everything else. 

This conversation could have been educational. It could have ended in some concrete takeaways that could have helped the users of that site, and maybe users of future projects. But instead both developers left the conversation raging at the other and I left, after attempting to mediate, feeling drained and exhausted,

I wish this feeling had ended there. But I'm still exhausted and sick of mediating. I'm writing this partially to emplore everyone to put the damn pitchforks down, but also, frankly, because I need to vent.

A framework choice is not a personality. There is no right or wrong choice. Just the right choice for a particular team and project and time. 

All that us vs them does is foster a culture of superiority and gatekeeping.

Yes, we should be considering the user first. But as long as that's considered, at the end of the day. the tool you use to get the job done is just a tool. 

People are not inherently bad because of the tools they're using at their workplace.

Now, I'm not saying there isn't a problem. There are, without a doubt some very loud toxic voices in the React community. But by acknowledging and subtweeting them we're amplifying this noise and drowning out people who have more interesting things to say.

Yesterday particularly hit a nerve 


Can we all step down off our high horses and try to actually listen to each other?
I feel the same. I leaned towards learning Vue before React because the community seemed more friendly and helpful.







But there are plenty of intelligent React devs building accessible user-centered
